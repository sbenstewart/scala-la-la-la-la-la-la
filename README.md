The Scala song in Scala.

<video controls>

## Prerequisites

To use this website the following is what you'll have to do.

* Clone this repository, or download it into your local machine.
* Install scala into your machine.
* Run the code to play the song!
```code
$scala -cp jfugue-5.0.9.jar code.scala
```

And. There is one more even easier way to access the audio. Just click on [this link.](audio.mp3)

## Why this ?

This was written because of one [Ben Stewart](https://sbenstewart.in/) who had once forgotten to play [this music piece](sheet.pdf). He is making amends by coding it out with a keyboard, albeit only the intro/outro bit of the song. He had  to go through the painful process of [reading the docs](docs.pdf) and with prior knowledge of the [sheet music](mapping.jpg) had to digitise the piece out.

## How this ?

The stuff used are as follows:

1. [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) as it wouldn't make sense to use anything else.
2. [JFugue](http://www.jfugue.org/) to not re-invent the music player.
3. [Tony Christie - Is This The Way To Amarillo](https://youtu.be/qn0iP1pAr_4?t=128) without which it will never exist.
